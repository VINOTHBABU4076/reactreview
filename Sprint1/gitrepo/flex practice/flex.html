HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.Web-hosting-300x427px.png

            What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained
            
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
            
            HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
            
                Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
                Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
                Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
            
            Its also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it cant create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 
            
            This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.

            How Does HTML Work
            HTML Historical Milestones infographic
            
            The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.
            
            HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
            
            All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.  </p>
